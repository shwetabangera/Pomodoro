# PomodoroTechnique Timer:-
The Pomodoro Technique is a time-management framework which is as simple as it is effective - you use a timer to break your work into time blocks (usually 25 minutes), separated by a 5 minute break. After every 4 pomodoros, you can take a longer break.
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system that encourages people to work with the time they haveâ€”rather than against it. Using this method, you break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks. These intervals are referred to as pomodoros. After about four pomodoros, you take a longer break of about 15 to 20 minutes.

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

The technique has been widely popularized by dozens of apps and websites providing timers and instructions. Closely related to concepts such as timeboxing and iterative and incremental development used in software design, the method has been adopted in pair programming contexts.
